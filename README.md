# All In One Trading Engine

## Introduction
The All In One Trading Engine is designed for professional and advanced traders. This powerful application combines features like real-time charting, PnL tracking, market data integration, and algorithmic trading, making it a comprehensive platform for managing trading activities. The application integrates with Interactive Brokers (IBKR) for live market data and order management, and supports additional features via various APIs for enhanced functionality.

## Getting Started

### Requirements 
- Rust (version 1.50 or higher)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devshimi/ultimate-trading-app.git
cd ultimate-trading-app
```

Install the necessary dependencies (Rust package manager):
```sh
cargo build
```

### Running the Application

```sh
cargo run
```

## Features Overview

### Core Features
- **Custom Exceptions**: Handles critical issues such as configuration errors, authentication failures, and database issues, providing robust error handling throughout the application.
- **Logger Setup**: Includes a rotating file logger and console stream handler to ensure detailed logging for all activities, making debugging and tracking easier.
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as configuration files and user credentials, are securely encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption.
- **Configuration and Authentication**: Secure loading and saving of configuration settings. User authentication is performed using bcrypt-hashed passwords for enhanced security.
- **Database Integration**: Uses SQLite to manage trades, positions, and historical data. The app interacts with a relational database via Diesel ORM for smooth data management.
- **Positions Management**: Tracks open positions, calculates the average cost, and computes both realized and unrealized PnL for each symbol.
- **Market Data Integration**: Fetches historical market data from APIs like Yahoo Finance, and supports option chain data and SEC filings.
- **IBKR Integration**: Establishes a live connection with Interactive Brokers to fetch real-time market data, place orders, and subscribe to Depth of Market (DOM) and Time & Sales (T&S) data.
- **Alert System**: Set up technical or price-based alerts that trigger user-defined callbacks.
- **Backtesting Engine**: Implements a backtesting system where users can test their algorithms on historical market data using strategies like Simple Moving Average (SMA).
- **Real-Time Charting**: Displays real-time candlestick charts for selected symbols.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: The application includes role-based access control, where users can have different permissions based on their roles (Admin, Trader, ReadOnly, Analyst). Administrators have full access, while traders can manage positions, bots, and run backtests.
- **Trading Account Management**: Add or remove trading accounts and manage different strategies within each account.
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: A built-in editor for algorithmic trading strategies with syntax highlighting, breakpoints, and variable watching. You can write, debug, and run algorithms in real-time.

### UI Tabs Overview
- **Market Dashboard**: A real-time candlestick chart showing live price data for selected symbols.
- **Option Chain**: Displays option chain data, including available strikes, expirations, and bid/ask prices.
- **SEC Filings**: Retrieves and displays the latest SEC filings for a given symbol.
- **Alerts**: Create and manage price-based alerts for real-time notifications.
- **Backtest**: Run a backtest using historical data with simple strategies, such as SMA.
- **DOM & T&S**: Displays Depth of Market and Time & Sales data for symbols, directly integrated with IBKR.
- **Orders**: Manage and track live orders, including placing, canceling, and updating orders.
- **Bots**: Manage and configure algorithmic trading bots for automated trading strategies.
- **Positions**: Tracks open positions in your account, showing current holdings, quantity, and PnL.
